    <h1>BLOG#1 SETTING UP A WEBSITE</h1>

            <p>Due to the Covid issue, I have been self-quarantined since 19 May 2022. 
                Stuck at home, I have decided to learn HTML and CSS coding. 
                Youtube is always a good place to start with. Instead of learning it from basic, 
                I took a short cut. Considering I had already learnt a little bit HTML coding in secondary school. 
                I just found a tutorial on Youtube and follow the example to build up my website. Once the frame is done, 
                I started to modify the content and adding my picture in it. 
                Finally, finished my website which took me approximately a week.

            <h3>Why I wanted to build a website?</h3>
            <p>The reason is simple, I want to have a place display my works. 
                Despite the Instagram is a great platform for me to show my works, it limited the format of post 
                , the text description and picture counts. 
                And that is not what I want to display my works.
                 The other platform I tried, for example, Wordpress. It's convenience to setting a website, 
                 however, I still found it hard to fully customise a website the way i wanted, especially in the free version. 
                 Therefore, I decided to spend time to build a website by coding. And I'm glad I did that.
            </p>

        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="BLOGS/BLOG1/css.jpg">
            <h3>Process and Difficulties</h3>
            <p>Although I learned the basic of HTML coding at high school, 
                I forgot pretty much everything by now and I'm quite sure that I did not learn the CSS. 
                Therefore, when I decided to follow the tutorial to build a website, 
                it was confusing for me to understand. Especially the css code, I have absolutely no idea. 
                <p>However, during the process I started to find the patterns. 
                I was surprised that it was quite eazy to understand. 
                The HTML file determine the frame and content of a website. 
                And CSS file is to decided how the contents are being shown. 
                CSS is like a designer of the website which contain the position, color, 
                background and more informations of each elements. When I started to modify my website,
                 it can be quite messy when codes started to getting more and more. 
                 I think it was not hard to get the effect I want because what I want is simple. However,
                  organising the codes and make them clear and simple is the hardest part. </p>
            </p>

            <p>On the other hand, making a website from coding gives me maximum freedom to custom my website.
                 The whole process is like designing a poster with code instead of photoshop. 
                 The outcome might be less straight forward, you might have to refresh the page a few times to see the outcome.
                  In the end I'm satisfied with this website.</p>

            <h3>The imperfections </h3>
            <p>Despite the website can achieve what I want now, I can pre-see some problems that will happen in the future. 
                For example, I will running out of Github's space because it only offer 500MB of space for free user. 
                Besides, this website also have some downsides. What I have did on this website is mainly just the font-end web development. 
                The website lacks of a lot of other functions, functions that can be done with JAVASCRIPT or other languages. 
                For example, I can't collect feedbacks of visitors on this website. I can't save any data of visitors. 
                And I can not even know how to record visitor counts on this website. 
                If you know some easy way to achieve those functions, please do let me know. Thanks :)
