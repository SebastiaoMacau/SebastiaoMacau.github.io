            <p>It has already been 2 years since the last Blog was posted. 
Can you believe it? Time flies. Anyways, I know nobody gives a shit on this website. 
So I just talk to myself. Just do a brief review on what happened in the past 2 years. 
And I will come back to read it 10 years later.

<h3>My First Full time Job</h3>
<div class="context">
            
     
            <p><img src="BLOGS/BLOG3/1.jpg">Shortly after the last blog, The COVID generation finally came to an end. Just so sudden, the government decided to cancel all the COVID related policies. Everything was getting back to normal slowly. Really can’t believe I lived in such a ridiculous period… and survived!!! Meanwhile, I also managed to find a full time job right after the COVID ended. Actually, The whole story of me finding a job was… absolutely unexpected. Just a random normal day in February, I was surfing the job-hunting website as I did in the past 1 year. A job came into my sight. It’s quite a unique job, not the ordinary jobs you can see everyday on the job hunting website. And I met some of the requirements of the job also, for example, knowledge in 3D modeling. The other requirements of the job are quite interesting, one of the conditions is willing to travel on a business trip to Bangladesh. Interesting… I hesitated. But anyways, I really wanted to get a full time job, already quite desperate … to be honest. Fun fact I learnt from my job hunting experience. When a job makes you hesitate to send the CV or not. Don’t hesitate, just send it. Only 1 out of the 10 CV you sent would have a reply. So I just sent my CV and portfolio to the email attached. And the next morning, Before I even awake, the company called me and made an appointment with me on the same day afternoon. I was like… OK! well, I don’t have anything to do anyway, I was unemployed… To be honest, I don’t think I would get the offer of this job… because I had already attended dozens of interviews already. Most of them did not have any reply. </p>

<img src="BLOGS/BLOG3/2.jpg">So… I just get up… go to the gym. After the gym, I go to interview directly, without any preparation, just wearing a casual outfit. In the first part of the interview… was quite normal, same as my other interview, funny thing is they did ask me a few times to confirm if I can go to the business trip in bangladesh. I was like… yeah, ok, of course, sure, why not? and they seems a bit surprise lol. to be honest, my really thought was… whatever, I think they wouldn’t hire me anyways, and there must be other candidate better than me, smarter than me, more hard working than me. so perhaps, I won’t be the one. And than was quite normal, the boss asked me a few questions, but I don’t know how to answer because It is beyond my knowledge. the situation was quite awkward. I was 90% sure I won’t get the offer. And at the end of the interview… I think they won’t hire me anyways, but I am quite interest in the products they produced. So I asked them if I could have a look at all the products the display in the office. The boss was very nice… he show me every products in the office and explain them to me. And that is when the our vibes are synchronize. I told them I am quite admire in the products they produced. At this moment I did share some of my very superficial knowledges in their products. And we communicate a lot… Turns out, the whole interview wraps up quite well. ANd in the next day, I got the offer. Oh well, and that was the moment I really start to consider the question - if I am willing to travel to Bangladesh or not. One tip for you when looking for a job: when you receive an offer, never answer yes or no directly, always tell the HR that you answer them later, so that you can take some times to think and make a good decision. And at the end, I took the offer.

            <h3>Time Flies</h3>

           
            <p>So that is what happened in the past 2 years. I got a job, busy working and learning. Met new friends and colleagues. Everyday is basically working, eat, gym and sleep. Sometimes I did feel I don’t know where all my time goes, thankfully I am doing something I loved and I’m interested in. Even so, I did feel exhausted sometimes. I was so busy that I forgot I have a personal website. And the free domain expired 1 year ago. So the website went down with it also. And now, finally, I have some time to put it back online again. This time, I don’t think I will use a first level domain for my website anymore. I’ll just leave it in sub-domain with github. So that I don’t need to redirect my website every year, and I don’t need to pay anything for the website, which is great!

            <h3>Website Updates </h3>
            <p>And now, I’m not just putting my website back on again. I also upgraded a feature. When you visit my home page, you’ll see a visitor counter. I made it 2 years ago, but the function is not working properly. Everytime you click my home page, the counter will start to count from 1. and cannot record a real status of how many visits on my website. And I’ve checked the solutions, it seems it requires a backend for the website to make the counter work. seems complicated. So I did not improve it back then. Until now, I decided to fix it. And time changes, instead of going on the internet to find tutorials. I just asked ChatGPT, it gave me a few solutions and taught me step by step. It even did the coding for me, all I needed to do was just follow its steps, copy and paste, and then… It works! I didn’t even need to understand the code, it just did everything for me. So from now on, Maybe I’ll try to update a few blogs whether there are people to read or not. Just trying to share some of my thoughts and what I’ve been doing… This website is like a tree hole of mine. Moreover, maybe I'll try to update some 3D projects in my Showcase, I don't really have much time to make 3D anymore. So it's gonna be slow... Hopefully I can display a few mroe projects on it in the future. Last but not least, I am planning to add a Gallery section in this website. For displaying some photos I took. So... stay tuned! More content coming soon!!!
