            <p>It has been half a year since I published my last blog. 
                I almost forgot how to update my website. LoL. 
                The second half of 2022 is quite tough to me. 
                I was struggling to find a proper job. I have been trying to find 
                a full time job since I graduate. Meanwhile, this year I have
                 tried some new things, set some new targets. Hoping to find 
                 a way out or make some money.

            <h3>BEHANCE</h3>
            <p>Recently, I joined Behance community. I had heard about this 
                community of designer before, but I did not set up an account 
                until last month. I found that Behance really gather a lot of 
                outstanding designers and it also offer a great space to display 
                your artworks. In Behance, user can upload their works as a project 
                and add descriptions to explain it. Which is the ideal place for 
                people to display their works. Wish I had found out earlier, then 
                I will not have to build my own website. Nevertheless, building a 
                website by code is a good experience and it is quite fun, to be 
                honest. Besides, the biggest advantage of Behance isâ€¦ it support 
                to upload large HD image. The biggest drawback of instagram for me 
                to share photo is It compress my images. Instagram is designed for 
                smart phones, and when I upload an image, it really compress a lot 
                and lost a lot of details. Therefore, Behance is a better place for 
                designers. And if you are reading this article, you can follow my

               <p> In this few months, I made some new practice in Cinema4D. 
                It is not much, but there are some. I also had a lot of ideas of 
                things I want to make, for example, F1 cars, motorsports stuffs 
                or some sci-fi related project. However, I do not think I can handle 
                a complicate model like F1, I still have a lot to learn and practice. 
                Apart from new projects, I also review some old projects. For example the
                 Ferrari Steering Wheel. I wanna enhance the LV theme. Therefore, I made a 
                 LV trunk and compose a new series of pictures.</p>

            <h3>YOUTUBE</h3>
            <p>Apart from more practices in Cinema4D. 
                I also started to develop my second interest - SimRacing.
                 I made some videos on YouTube, recording myself playing 
                 racing games. At first, I tried to make some short videos around 
                 3~5 mins. Maybe doing some hot-laps. And then, I have also tried to 
                 record some long videos. Recording the whole race and commenting 
                 it. It show huge difference between short and long videos. Well, 
                 obviously people are too busy to watch long videos. (Or maybe my 
                 videos are too boring, in fact, they are. LoL) For long videos, I 
                 just got a dozen views. And for short videos, it can reach hundreds.
                  And for now, my channel only got 3 subscribers. LoL. I do not know 
                  who they are, but I really appreciate them.

            <h3>Health and Fitness </h3>
            <p>There are couple waves of pandemic in MACAU in the second half 
                of 2022. And thanks god, the government finally put a fullstop on 
                this madness. This whole Covid drama had cost us too much and changed
                 everyone's life. Anyways, my gym buddy had graduate and come 
                 back Macau. Therefore, I picked up my workout goal and treated it 
                 very serious...... again. Eventually, I gain 8kg of body weight  of 
                 which is the muscle I lost during my "lazy year" by the end of 
                 2022. 
                </p>
<br>
                <p>So, that's the wrap of 2022. Still unemployed, lost, young no more, dumb and broke.
                    I hope life will get better in 2023. Really not sure when will I write the next 
                    blog. Doesn't matter. I think there is no body reading this anyways. Perhaps, I will 
                    came back and read this 10 years later. IDK. :D
