    <h1>Ferrari F1 Steering Wheel</h1>
    <p>I recreated a Formula 1 Steering Wheel in Cinema 4D</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="ARTWORKs/SteeringWheel/cover.jpg">
            <h3>Motive</h3>
            <p>The Formula 1 2021 season was absolutely fascinating. 
                And I become a big fan of formula 1 since I watched 
                Netflix F1 Documentary [Drive to Survive] in 2020. 
                    Although some  rivalries of drivers in the show 
                    is exaggerate, it is the best way to let a newbie 
                    start to know more about Formula 1. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="ARTWORKs/SteeringWheel/Back.jpg">
            
            <p>And because I am now a big fan of Formula 1. 
                I always wanted to create something related to Formula 1.
                 I tried modelling a formula 1 car, but it is too hard 
                 for me right now. It was so so hard to get every details
                  right since F1 cars are very complicated machines. 

                Therefore, I tried to model other things instead, a Ferrari F1 Steering Wheel. This is a 3D F1 steering wheel model I recreated on Cinema 4D. 
                
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="ARTWORKs/SteeringWheel/MODEL.jpg">
            <h3>The Model</h3>
            <p>The main reason I choose this particular steering wheel to recreate is because there are lots of references on the internet.
                So that I can find a lot of pictures as a reference to
                 model. I think the base of the steering wheel is the 
                 hardest part because I have to get the shape right. 
                 Fortunately the base is symmetry, 
                 so I just have to model half of the base and mirror 
                 the other half. Once I got the base done, whatâ€™s left was
                  just the bottoms and their labels. Pure Grinding! It was
                   not hard though, but it took me a couple days to 
                   finish it all. When everything was done and with 
                   proper lighting, the result is quite stunning.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="facilities-col">
            <h3>The Alternatives </h3>
            <p>I added a Ferrari text logo in the middle of 
                the steering wheel. The original one does not 
                have the logo perhaps they wanted to reduce weight. 
                But I like to add a text logo on it and I think it 
                fits in quite well.

            <h3>LV Sponsor Concept </h3>
            <p>Have you ever wonder what would a steering 
                looks when LV decided to join Formula 1? Base 
                on this idea, I change the grip of the steering wheel
                 to a leather with LV logos on it. LoL. I think it 
                 actually looks OK. Right?
